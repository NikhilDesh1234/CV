  I had completed my graduation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science_in_Information_Technology#:~:text=A%20Bachelor%20of%20Science%20in,in%20the%20Information%20technology%20field.&text=This%20degree%20is%20primarily%20focused,software%2C%20databases%2C%20and%20networking.">BSc IT</a> from <a href="http://nktdegreecollege.org/">NKTT degree college</a> of
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thane">Thane</a>-Maharashtra.
 <hr/>
While pursiving my graduation I was studying, I used to stay in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalwa,_Thane">Kalwa.</a>
there were many companies in thane like <a href="https://www.capgemini.com/in-en/">Capgemini</a> , <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larsen_%26_Toubro"> L and T</a> , <a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/global">JP morgan</a>.
But these were non of my interest.
<hr/>
From my young age i got an hobby to teach students and help them achieve their goals , so i suggested them some educational websites to learn coding, these websites were <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3schools</a> , <a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/">Javatpoint</a>.
<hr/>
As I grew up I started liking the programming language <a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/help/whatis_java.html">Java</a>, whereas my friends were liking the programming language of <a href="https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/">Python</a>.
<hr/>
It was fun to learn <a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/what-is-core-java">Core Java</a>, beacuse it was an platform independent language. After then I had developed my interest in development of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software"> Softwares</a> , <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website"> Websites</a> as well as <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-is-an-application">Applications</a>.
<hr/>
Further, <a href="https://acuityeducare.com/">Acuity Educare</a> helped me to achieve my goals by providing some best courses!
<hr/>
Then I decided to work as a <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/tech-jobs/web-development/full-stack-developer">Full Stack Developer</a> , in <a href="https://www.webwise.ie/parents/explainer-what-is-snapchat-2/">Snapchat</a>.

<u>Questions and answers which I get to asked the most:</u><br/>
Q1.What is Server side scripting? <br/>
<br/>
Ans:Server-side scripting is a technique used in web development which involves employing scripts on a web server which produces a response customized for each user's (client's) request to the website. The alternative is for the web server itself to deliver a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page">static web page</a>. Scripts can be written in any of a number of server-side scripting languages that are available. Server-side scripting is distinguished from client-side scripting where embedded scripts, such as <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_js.asphttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">JavaScript</a>, are run client-side in a web browser, but both techniques are often used together. Server-side scripting also enables the website owner to hide the source code that generates the <a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/interface-in-java">interface</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Q2.What is Client side scripting? <br/>
<br/>
Ans:Client-side scripting simply means running scripts, such as JavaScript, on the client device, usually within a browser. ... Server-side scripts run on the server instead of the client, often in order to deliver <a href="https://www.omniconvert.com/what-is/dynamic-content/">dynamic content</a> to webpages in response to user actions.
JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, which means the source code is processed by the client's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser"> web browser</a> rather than on the web server. This means JavaScript functions can run after a webpage has loaded without communicating with the <a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/server">server</a>.
